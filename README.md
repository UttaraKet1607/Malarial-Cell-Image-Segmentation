## Image Segmentation

- Sub-domain of computer visvion that deals with grouping similar regions or segments of an image under their respective class labels.
- Segmentation allows us to organize the data contained within images and videos into meaningful categories. 
- While image classification and object detection may tell us the presence and location of certain objects, segmentation allows us to dive deeper. It involves image feature localization in addition to just classification. 
- The model developed for image segmentation pinpoints towards a corresponding object present in the image by outlining the object's boundary. 

### 1. Features of image segmentation model

- It consists of an encoder-decoder pair instead of the single encoder present in classifiers.
  - Encoder: The encoder encodes a latent space representation of the input and is usually is a pre-trained classification network.
  - Decoder: The task of the decoder is to decode form segment maps, or in other words map outlines of each objectâ€™s location in the image.
